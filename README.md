# AWS-prac

This is the repository for me to store my Anki cards for the AWS practitioner course. I'm currently following through [the Cloud Essentials Learning Plan](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/lp/82/cloud-essentials-learning-plan). The deck should be live at [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/255577638), but note that the website messes up the formatting of the sample notes.
