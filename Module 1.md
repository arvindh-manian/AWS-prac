# Module 1

This module is basically just a high-level overview of AWS.

## Introduction

- AWS services:
	- Computing
	- Storage
	- Network security
	- Blockchain
	- ML
	- AI
	- Robot development platforms
	- Video production management
	- Orbital satellites

	

### Fundamental Cloud Compute Model
- Basic client-server model is the lynchpin
- Just like how clients request baristas for coffee, clients request servers to do things
	- The barista in this example would be an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC instance)

### Pay for What You Use
- The owner of the coffee shop pays employees based on how they're used (i.e., in the store working)
- Same philosophy applies to AWS
- So businesses don't pay for AWS when they're not using resources, saving money -- you don't prepay for anything

## Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing is "the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet using pay-as-you-go pricing"
- On-demand — AWS gives you the resources when you need them — you can **instantly** scale up and down
	- Not possible when managing your own data centers
- IT resources — "undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT" — AWS' goal is to take control of repetitive tasks that don't differentiate companies from their competitors
- Over the internet — you can control resources using the web or code
- Pay-as-you-go — only pay for what you use and need


### Deployment Models for Cloud Computing
- Companies have to consider many factors: required cloud app components, the tools they want to use, and the compatibility of legacy code
- **Cloud-based deployment** means you:
	- Run all parts of the app in the cloud
	- Migrate existing apps to the cloud
	- Design and build new apps in the cloud
	- **Can** build apps on low-level infra (even though it's in the cloud!)
- **On-premises deployment** (**private cloud deployment**) means you:
	- Deploy resources using virtualization and other tools
	- Necessarily have higher utilization bc of virtualization and app management tech
	- Keep the tech in-house
- **Hybrid Deployment** means you:
	- Use cloud-based stuff in conjunction with in-house infra (can be important for regulation reasons)
	- Integrate that cloud tech with your legacy apps
### Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Low up-front costs
- Less energy spent managing computing infra
- Don't need to predict usage (bc of pay-as-you-go)
- Lower variable cost — AWS has economics of scale
- Faster deployment and more flexibility
- Low latency
